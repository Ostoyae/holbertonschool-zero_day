This project is ment to introduce us to what a virtual machine (VM), doing so with Vagrant. I Open-sourced project that was started my Mitchell Hashimoto in Jan of 2010. In 2012 with the first stable release of 1.0 in March of 2012, Mitchell formed an organization called "HashiCorp".

The Vm is writen in the Ruby Language it was also originally tied to VirtualBox (Another popular Vm made by Oracle), but V1.1 added support for other vitualization software.

This project also Segways up into the Ubuntu. Produced by Canonical it is also an open-source operation system (OS) widely used in servers, and the cloud services. Canonical had adopted the name "Ubuntu" from the Southern African philosophy of ubuntu (literally, 'human-ness').

As our first boot of the Vm with Ubuntu/Trusty64 we feed it the cmd "uname" which then prints out "Linux".

finally also learn what "zero-day" has a deeper mean in computing. "zero-day" (also known as 0-day) is a vulnerability that is unknown to those who would be otherwise interested in mitigating it.
